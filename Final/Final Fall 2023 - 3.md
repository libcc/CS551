## Write a C function int barrier(number of blocked argument, limit argument) which is used in athreaded program and blocks each thread request until the number of blocked threades reaches the limit argument.


To implement a barrier in C using threads, we can use the `pthread` library. A barrier is a synchronization mechanism that makes threads wait until a specific number of threads (the `limit` argument) have reached a certain point in the code. Once the limit is reached, all threads can proceed.

Here is a simple implementation of the `barrier` function using `pthread`:

### Code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <pthread.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

typedef struct {
    int blocked;         // Number of threads currently blocked
    int limit;           // Limit for how many threads to block before releasing
    pthread_mutex_t lock; // Mutex to protect shared data
    pthread_cond_t cond;  // Condition variable for signaling
} Barrier;

// Initialize the barrier
void barrier_init(Barrier *barrier, int limit) {
    barrier->blocked = 0;
    barrier->limit = limit;
    pthread_mutex_init(&barrier->lock, NULL);
    pthread_cond_init(&barrier->cond, NULL);
}

// Barrier function that blocks threads until the limit is reached
int barrier_wait(Barrier *barrier) {
    pthread_mutex_lock(&barrier->lock); // Acquire the lock

    barrier->blocked++; // Increment the count of blocked threads

    if (barrier->blocked >= barrier->limit) {
        // If the limit is reached, broadcast to all waiting threads
        pthread_cond_broadcast(&barrier->cond);
        barrier->blocked = 0; // Reset the count for the next round
    } else {
        // Wait until the condition variable is signaled
        pthread_cond_wait(&barrier->cond, &barrier->lock);
    }

    pthread_mutex_unlock(&barrier->lock); // Release the lock

    return 0;
}

// Destroy the barrier (clean up resources)
void barrier_destroy(Barrier *barrier) {
    pthread_mutex_destroy(&barrier->lock);
    pthread_cond_destroy(&barrier->cond);
}

// Example worker thread function
void *worker(void *arg) {
    Barrier *barrier = (Barrier *)arg;
    printf("Thread %lu waiting at the barrier\n", pthread_self());
    
    // Wait at the barrier
    barrier_wait(barrier);
    
    printf("Thread %lu passed the barrier\n", pthread_self());
    return NULL;
}

int main() {
    const int NUM_THREADS = 5;
    pthread_t threads[NUM_THREADS];
    Barrier barrier;

    // Initialize the barrier to block until 5 threads reach the barrier
    barrier_init(&barrier, NUM_THREADS);

    // Create threads
    for (int i = 0; i < NUM_THREADS; i++) {
        pthread_create(&threads[i], NULL, worker, (void *)&barrier);
    }

    // Join threads
    for (int i = 0; i < NUM_THREADS; i++) {
        pthread_join(threads[i], NULL);
    }

    // Destroy the barrier
    barrier_destroy(&barrier);

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Barrier Struct**: The `Barrier` structure holds the state of the barrier:
   - `blocked`: The current number of threads that are blocked (waiting at the barrier).
   - `limit`: The number of threads required to unblock and allow all threads to continue.
   - `lock`: A `pthread_mutex_t` used to synchronize access to the `blocked` count.
   - `cond`: A `pthread_cond_t` (condition variable) used to signal all threads when the barrier is released.

2. **barrier_init()**: Initializes the barrier's state and prepares it for use by setting up the mutex and condition variable.

3. **barrier_wait()**: 
   - Each thread calls this function when it reaches the barrier.
   - If the number of blocked threads reaches the `limit`, the barrier releases all threads by calling `pthread_cond_broadcast()`.
   - Otherwise, threads wait on the condition variable until they are signaled.

4. **barrier_destroy()**: Cleans up the mutex and condition variable after all threads have finished using the barrier.

5. **worker()**: This function simulates the work done by each thread. It waits at the barrier, and once all threads reach the barrier, they proceed.

6. **Main function**:
   - Creates `NUM_THREADS` threads.
   - Each thread waits at the barrier.
   - Once all threads are waiting, the barrier releases them, and they all proceed.

This is a basic barrier implementation suitable for simple threaded programs.

## ⚙️ Lab 4

Run each of the following commands in separate windows of the terminal (you have 3 programs, so run them in 3 separate windows - manage, compute or tcompute, and report):

First program:
```
./manage
```

Second program:
```
./compute START
```
or:
```
./tcompute START
```

Third program:
```
./report
```

To kill all the processes, run this command:
```
./report -k
```


If you got permission denied, first run this to change the file permission:
```
chmod 777 filename
```
